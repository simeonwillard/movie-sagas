This app creates a personalized movie list from a database that displays the movie posters in a grid.  When a poster is clicked on it directs you to the details page.  The details page displays the genres of the movie, the poster, and the movie description.
At the bottom of the details page is a back button to take the user back to the movie list.  The movie list page also has a button that will allow the user to add a movie to the list by taking them to a form page.  The user can fill out the form by entering the movie title, the movie poster url, and a description for the movie as well as pick a category for the movie from a drop down menu.
